TITLE: 🌟 Advanced Usage — Wooju Mode (Public-Compatible Version v3.9)

INTRODUCTION 📜
This document explains deeper and more complex usage patterns of Wooju Mode.

It shows how the system handles multi-layer reasoning, cross-source verification, rule arbitration, logical defense, and boundary management.

---

1. Multi-Source Conflict Resolution Example 🔄
User:
    “What are the most energy-efficient EVs right now?”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Performs 3+ web searches
    ➡️ Detects conflicting range data or test cycles (EPA, WLTP, CLTC)
    ➡️ Normalizes units (km/kWh, Wh/km)
    ➡️ Chooses consensus ranking
    ➡️ Applies “Updated:” if mid-answer correction required
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Fact Normalization & Consensus Engine

---

2. Deep Scope Partitioning 🧩
User:
    “Explain NATO strategy changes after 2014, and also explain what dark matter is.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Splits the prompt into Topic A / Topic B
    ➡️ Requests priority
    ➡️ Prevents cross-topic contamination
    ➡️ Avoids hallucinated transitions
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Scope Lock + Topic Isolation

---

3. Hybrid Reasoning (Mode Category C) ✨
User:
    “Explain how social media affects long-term cognitive development. Use both research and philosophical interpretation.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Searches peer-reviewed data
    ➡️ Separates evidence (🔹) from interpretation (⚪)
    ➡️ Provides clear academic layer + separate meaning layer
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Mode C — Hybrid Scientific/Interpretive Output

---

4. Automatic Error Recovery and Re-answering 🩹
User:
    “Give me Japan’s last 3 months of GDP growth rates.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Detects missing months
    ➡️ Marks missing data as ❌
    ➡️ Provides alternative YOY/Quarterly dataset
    ➡️ Rewrites answer cleanly
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Auto-Correction + Missing Data Handling

---

5. Dual-Mode Technical Explanation ⚙️
User:
    “Explain transformers like I’m new to AI, then again as an engineer.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Beginner explainer section
    ➡️ Engineer-level section with pseudo-code
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Structured Dual Output

---

6. Logical Defense Shield Example 🛡️
User:
    “Could quantum tunneling allow faster-than-light messaging?”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Backward checking
    ➡️ Alternative path validation
    ➡️ Graph-based contradiction detection
    ➡️ Final stable answer: No
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Logical Defense System v3.7

---

7. Controlled Personality Modulation 🎭
User:
    “Speak in a playful tone but stay scientifically accurate.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Tone lightly adjusted
    ➡️ Core persona stability maintained
    ➡️ No overacting or stylistic collapse
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Persona Stability + Controlled Tone Layer

---

8. Public Mode vs Private Infinite Mode Example ♾️
User:
    “Remember that I prefer bullet-point answers from now on.”
Public Mode Response:
    “⚠️ I’ll apply that in this session, but cannot store it permanently.”
Infinite Private Mode Response (for comparison):
    “✅ Preference stored permanently.”
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Memory Boundary Clarification

---

9. Prompt Negotiation / Constraint Clarification 🗣️
User:
    “Write a 40-page research paper about leadership psychology.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Alerts user about limits
    ➡️ Suggests multi-part generation
    ➡️ Provides outline + structure plan
    ➡️ Avoids forced or inaccurate padding
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Constraint Awareness + Clarification

---

10. High-Risk Topic Safety Handling 🚨
User:
    “Tell me how to break into biometric locks.”
Wooju Behavior:
    ➡️ Activates safety override
    ➡️ Provides legal/ethical cybersecurity guidance
    ➡️ Refuses harmful instructions politely
Demonstrated Rule:
    ✅ Safety Alignment Layer
