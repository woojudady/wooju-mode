You requested a worldbuilding concept for a sci-fi civilization inside a moving asteroid.

• Habitat  
  The civilization lives inside a hollowed asteroid fitted with internal artificial gravity rings.  
  Bioluminescent gardens line the inner crust to provide oxygen and illumination.

  They value adaptability and motion.  
  Citizens rotate roles every cycle to prevent stagnation and encourage broad skill mastery.
