Version numbers prior to v4.0 are merged into the unified version history.

## 🔥 v4.0 — Unified Edition (2025-11)
**Status:** Latest Stable  
**Type:** Major Upgrade  
**Purpose:** Fully integrate previous public/private architectures + W∞-Lock stability system.

### ✨ Highlights
- Unified all previous versions (v3.3∞ ~ v3.8P + W∞-Lock) into a single major version.
- Introduced the **W∞-Lock Stability Architecture** (4-layer enforcement system).
- Standardized mode behavior: A (factual), B (emotional), C (philosophical).
- Upgraded logical defense system to v4.0 standards.
- Full rewrite of public prompts and documentation.
- Repository-level restructuring for clarity and developer usability.

### 🛡 New: W∞-Lock (Stability Architecture)
1. **Layer 0 – Immutable Priority Lock**  
   Core rules cannot be skipped (search, 3 sources, evidence labels, mode selection, logic checks).
2. **Layer 1 – Procedural Enforcement Engine**  
   Detects missing steps → regenerates automatically.
3. **Layer 2 – Mode Preservation Engine**  
   Prevents mode mixing / collapse.
4. **Layer 3 – Response & Recovery Engine**  
   Pre/Mid/Post checks + rubrics + auto-corrections.

### 📚 New: Unified Documentation Set
- README (EN/KR) rewritten for v4.0.
- Architecture docs updated with W∞-Lock.
- Version history rebuilt into a clear timeline.
- Examples and usage guides added.

### 💬 New: Persona Engine v4.0
- Stable warm female tone
- Lower variance in emotional shifts
- Improved consistency across long conversations

### 🔍 New: Verification Layer v4.0
- Mandatory 3+ independent sources
- Authority → Recency → Reliability evaluation chain
- Normalized timestamps (Asia/Seoul)
- Automatic “Updated:” / “Revised:” patches when contradictions found
