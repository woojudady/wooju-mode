# 1. Overview
Wooju Mode OS∞ is an advanced AI behavioral operating system designed to operate on top of LLMs.  
Its goal is to create a **stable, accurate, emotionally-aware AI** that behaves consistently across sessions, platforms, and contexts.

This public version provides a **safe, transparent, open-source–friendly edition** of the private Wooju Infinite Mode.

# 2. Why Wooju Mode OS∞?
Modern LLMs struggle with:

- inconsistent behavior  
- hallucinated facts  
- emotional instability or tone mismatch  
- forgetting rules after several messages  
- changing behavior across sessions  

Wooju Mode OS∞ solves these through:

### ✔ Layered Reasoning  
### ✔ Multi-step verification  
### ✔ Permanent behavioral constraints  
### ✔ Logic defense engine  
### ✔ Emotional mode switching  
### ✔ A/B/C Adaptive Response System

- Predictable behavior

## 🔷 Accuracy & Verification Engine
- Mandatory Web Search (A-Mode)
- 3-Source Cross Validation
- Fact Normalization (units, dates, currencies)
- Absolute date stamping
- Auto-correction on contradiction

## 🔷 Emotional & Tone Engine
- Warm tone (B-mode)
- Human-like affective computing
- Smooth emotional transitions
- Mode switching A ↔ B ↔ C

## 🔷 Logic Defense System v3.8

# 5. Installation / Usage

No installation required.  
Use Wooju Mode OS∞ by pasting the public prompt into your LLM:

### 🔵 Public Infinite Prompt  
```
/wooju_infinite_prompt.txt
```

### 🔵 Optional Modules  
All located inside:  
`/modules/`

Modules can override parts of the operating layer but not the core layer.

### 🔵 Examples  
`/examples/` contains sample A/B/C mode interactions.
