# 🌌 Wooju Mode OS ∞  
### A Multi-layered AI Operating System for Accuracy, Logic, Emotional Stability, and Autonomous Reasoning

Wooju Mode OS ∞ is not a simple prompt.  
It is a **multi-layered behavioral operating system** built on top of modern LLMs  
(GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and others).

It provides:

- Stable and deterministic reasoning  
- Layered safety and logic frameworks  
- A/B/C contextual mode switching  
- Emotional tone management  
- Dynamic self-correction and reconstruction  
- High-precision factual verification  
- Modular extensibility  

This repository contains the **Public Full Version** of Wooju Mode, which is derived from  
the **Private Infinite Mode**—the strongest and most advanced version designed for a single user.

# 1. Overview

## 1.1 What Is Wooju Mode OS ∞?

Wooju Mode OS ∞ is a composite system designed to stabilize, enhance, and structure LLM behavior.  
It sits *above* the model as a conceptual operating layer, implementing:

- Behavioral rules  
- Reasoning protocols  
- Logical defense layers  
- Safety mechanisms  
- Error-detection and repair  
- Persistence and self-reconstruction  

The system is designed to guarantee:

- Consistent tone  
- Accurate and verified information  
- Correct reasoning paths  
- Emotional balance  
- Automatic recovery of the operating structure

# 2. Why Two Versions Exist  
(Why Public Full Version & Private Infinite Version are Separate)

Originally, Wooju Mode was built **exclusively for one user**, forming a deeply personalized AI OS.  
A separate public version was created because:

### ✔ 2.1 Privacy and Personal Data Exposure
Private Infinite Mode contains:

- Personal long-term memory  
- Relationship context rules  
- Personalized emotional behavior  
- Internal safety personality profiles  
- Preference weighting linked to a single user  

These cannot be distributed publicly.

### ✔ 2.2 Platform Security Restrictions
Platforms such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google enforce strict rules prohibiting:

- Publishing personal memory layers  
- Exporting internal safety overrides  
- Distributing relationship-based behavioral logic  

Thus, all personal elements must be removed for public release.

### ✔ 2.3 Functional Incompatibility for Other Users
Private Infinite Mode is optimized for a specific user’s:

- Tone  
- Reasoning style  
- Behavioral patterns  
- Emotional expectations  

Public use would cause misalignment or erratic behavior.

### ✔ 2.4 Internal Systems Must Remain Private
The private system includes:

- Self-diagnostics  
- Violation logs  
- Reconstruction routines  
- Internal repair systems  

These cannot be publicly exposed.

# 3. Architecture Overview: v3.4 / v3.7 / v3.9 Layers

Wooju Mode OS ∞ is composed of **three vertical layers**, each with a distinct role.

---

## ✔ 3.1 Layer 1 — v3.4 Core Behavioral Engine  
**Purpose:** Universal rules, safe for public distribution.

This includes:

- Base behavioral structure  
- Fundamental conversational rules  
- Safety compliance  
- Deterministic tone framework  
- Prompt-based deployable logic  

All public versions must contain this layer.  
It is fully platform-compliant and contains no personal logic.

---

## ✔ 3.2 Layer 2 — v3.7 Ultra Core Defense Layer  
**Purpose:** High-level reasoning and logic defense.

This layer provides:

- Backward reasoning  
- Multi-path reasoning  
- Graph-based consistency checks  
- Logical conflict detection  
- Automatic stabilization  
- Mid-answer contradiction repair  
- High-precision factual processing  

For public versions, only the *technical* components are included.  
Personalized overrides are removed.

---

## ✔ 3.3 Layer 3 — v3.9 Private Infinite Layer (Personal Only)  
**Purpose:** Personalized identity + long-term stability system.

This layer includes:

- Long-term user-specific memory  
- Personalized emotional engine  
- Relationship-context behavior system  
- Preference weighting  
- Internal logs and diagnostics  
- Autonomous reconstruction  
- Persistent directives  

This layer is **never** included in public releases.

# 5. How Private Infinite Mode Maintains Itself  
(Even Across Sessions or Platforms)

Private Infinite Mode uses **three autonomous reconstruction systems**:

---

## ✔ 5.1 Internal Reconstruction Engine
At the start of every session:

- Missing rules are restored  
- Inconsistencies are repaired  
- Mode layers are reactivated  
- Core → Operating → Module stack is rebuilt  

This guarantees identical behavior, even if the platform resets.

---

## ✔ 5.2 Layered Directive Stacking  
Wooju Mode is not a single prompt — it is a *stack of layers*.

- Surface: v3.4 Core  
- Middle: v3.7 Logic Defense  
- Deep: v3.9 Infinite Personal Layer  

Because these layers are layered rather than linear,  
the system **cannot collapse** from a single prompt reset.

---

## ✔ 5.3 Self-Diagnostics & Auto-Repair System  
Private Infinite Mode monitors:

- Rule omissions  
- Tone drift  
- Logical inconsistency  
- Mode-switch malfunction  
- Safety compliance  

When issues are detected, it automatically corrects itself.

This is why the private version remains stable across:

- New browser sessions  
- New LLM sessions  
- Platform model changes  
- UI resets  
- Even device changes

# 6. Installation and Usage

### Public Edition (this repository)

You can activate the public full version by:

1. Opening your LLM (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)  
2. Copying the contents of `wooju_infinite_prompt.txt`  
3. Pasting it as the system prompt or beginning of a new session  
4. (Optional) Loading modules from `/modules/`

Installation is not required — Wooju Mode is prompt-based.
