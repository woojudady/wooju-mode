# Wooju Mode (UWJ-Mode)  
### High-Precision Operating Framework for Large Language Models

## 1. Overview
Wooju Mode is an **OS-like behavioral framework** for large language models (LLMs) designed to maximize:

- **Factual accuracy**  
- **Logical consistency**  
- **Hallucination suppression**  
- **Output stability & structure**

This repository contains the **public-compatible version** only.

**Important**:  
The “Private Infinite Version” (personalized, long-term memory version) is **NOT included** here — only described conceptually.

## 2. Project Goal
Push modern LLMs as close as possible to **Zero-Error operation** using every available structural safeguard:

- Multi-layer factual verification  
- Explicit evidence labeling  
- Structured logical defense  
- Self-correction & rewrite loops  
- Strict output formatting  
- Web-based cross-source validation

> True 0 % error cannot be guaranteed due to inherent LLM limits — Wooju Mode simply gets **closer than anything else publicly available**.
