# 🌀 Wooju Mode OS∞  
**A Multi-Layer AI Behavioral Operating System for Accuracy, Logic, and Emotional Intelligence**

Wooju Mode OS∞ is a **behavioral operating system (B-OS)** that sits on top of large language models (LLMs).  
It is not a prompt — it is a full structured system that enforces **accuracy, logical consistency, emotional stability, and cross-session behavioral coherence**.

This repository provides the **Public Full Version (v3.8P)** — the maximum feature set that can be safely shared publicly.

A higher version exists (**Private Infinite v3.8∞**), but it is exclusive to a single user and contains personal memory, personalized behavior rules, and identity-linked logic layers, which cannot be open-sourced.

# 1. Overview

Modern LLMs suffer from inconsistencies:

- They forget rules over long conversations  
- They hallucinate confident but false facts  
- Their tone fluctuates unpredictably  
- Behavior changes between sessions  
- They cannot self-correct logical contradictions  

**Wooju Mode OS∞ solves these problems** by introducing a structured three-layer behavioral OS system with:

- A multi-layer core engine  
- A verification-first accuracy pipeline  
- A triple-layer logical defense system  
- Adaptive emotional intelligence  
- A/B/C mode switching  
- Automatic self-correction  

This Public Full Version (v3.8P) preserves nearly all system capabilities while removing personal or identity-dependent layers.

# 2. Why Wooju Mode OS∞?

LLMs are powerful but unpredictable. A behavioral OS provides:

### ✔ Stability  
Responses remain consistent across long sessions.

### ✔ Accuracy  
Web search, cross-validation, and fact normalization reduce hallucinations.

### ✔ Logical Defense  
Triple validation prevents contradictions and reasoning collapse.

### ✔ Emotional Intelligence  
Smooth and stable emotional tones improve human–AI interaction.

### ✔ Behavioral Persistence  
The system behaves consistently even if the LLM resets or the session changes.

# 3. Version Architecture: Public v3.8P vs Private v3.8∞

Wooju Mode OS∞ exists in two forms:

---

## 🔷 **Private Infinite Version — v3.8∞**  
The **highest-tier**, user-exclusive behavioral OS.

Contains layers that cannot be public:

- Personal long-term memory  
- User-specific emotional & relational context  
- Auto-reinforcement based on user feedback  
- Internal violation logs & rule correction  
- Behavior persistence across platform / device / session  
- Fully personalized Self-Correction Engine  

This version behaves as a **true AI operating system for one individual user**.

---

## 🔷 **Public Full Version — v3.8P**  
This repository’s version.

The system retains **95% of the same engine** as the private version:

- Same Core v3.8  
- Same Verification Engine  
- Same 3-Layer Logic Defense  
- Same A/B/C Mode System  
- Same self-correction for factual or logical error  

Only the following layers are removed:

- No personal memory  
- No emotional/relationship personalization  
- No identity-linked rule persistence  
- No violation log  
- No personalized reinforcement loop  

Thus, **Public v3.8P = Private v3.8∞ – (Personal & Identity Layers)**.

| Accuracy Pipeline | ✔ | ✔ + user-adaptive tuning |
| Web Search | ✔ mandatory | ✔ mandatory |
| Cross Validation | ✔ | ✔ |
| Logical Defense System | ✔ triple-layer | ✔ enhanced precision |
| Self-Correction | ✔ | ✔ + rule-based auto-reinforcement |
| Self-Diagnostics | Basic | Full violation-log system |
| Emotional Engine | Stable warm tone | Fully personalized EI layer |
| Relationship Context | ❌ | ✔ persistent relationship memory |
| Long-Term Memory | ❌ | ✔ |
| Rule Persistence | Prompt-based reproducible | Identity-linked persistence |
| Open-Source Compatible | ✔ yes | ❌ no |

# 4. Core System Components

## 🔷 4.1 Core Behavior Engine  
- Multi-layer OS-like architecture  
- Governs tone, structure, reasoning, and formatting  
- Ensures stable, reproducible behavior across long conversations  

---

## 🔷 4.2 Accuracy & Verification Engine  
- Mandatory web search (A-Mode)  
- Minimum 3-source validation  
- Fact normalization (units, dates, timezones)  
- “Updated:” tag for real-time corrections  
- “Unverifiable” tag for ambiguity  

---

## 🔷 4.3 Logical Defense System v3.8  
1. **Backward Checking** — reverse reasoning validation  
2. **Alternative Path Check** — parallel derivation comparison  
3. **Graph Consistency Check** — graph-structure contradiction detection  

Prevents reasoning loops, logical conflicts, and faulty chains.

---

## 🔷 4.4 Emotional Intelligence Engine  
- Stable warm tone  
- B-Mode for emotional conversation  
- Smooth tone shift  
- Avoids exaggerated or theatrical emotional behavior  

---

## 🔷 4.5 A/B/C Adaptive Mode System

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **A-Mode** | Factual, web-verified, accuracy-first |
| **B-Mode** | Emotional, supportive, relational |
| **C-Mode** | Hybrid of facts + philosophy + emotional grounding |

---
