# 🌐 Wooju∞ Mode — v4.0 Unified Edition
**High-Precision LLM Operating System Mode for Consistent, Verifiable AI Behavior**

Wooju Mode is a multi-layered OS-like execution framework designed to transform
a large language model (LLM) from a simple “Q&A assistant” into a highly stable,
high-accuracy, logic-driven AI system.

The public edition in this repository contains:
- The official Wooju Mode v4.0 prompt  
- Architecture documentation  
- Version history  
- Examples and usage guides  

This framework enables anyone to reproduce Wooju Mode’s structured,
high-precision behavior on any LLM platform.

# 1. Purpose of Wooju Mode 🎯

The goal of Wooju Mode is not merely **reducing errors** but building a structure
that pushes LLMs toward **near-zero-error performance** through deterministic,
procedural enforcement.

Wooju Mode v4.0 integrates:

- 🔍 Real-time web verification  
- 📚 Cross-validation from 3+ sources  
- 🧠 Logical consistency checks  
- ♻️ Auto-correction and self-diagnostics  
- 🧭 Evidence labeling (🔸🔹⚪❌)  
- 🧱 Structured answer formats  
- ❤️ Warm, stable emotional tone  
- 🛡 W∞-Lock Stability Architecture (procedure-enforced execution)

v4.0 represents the highest level of accuracy and consistency achievable
within the limitations of current LLMs.

# 3. Philosophy of the Public Edition 💡

The public edition of Wooju Mode is built upon the following principles:

- **Maximum factual accuracy**
- **Minimal hallucination**
- **Stable logical consistency**
- **Structured, predictable output**
- **User-safe tone and style**

Wooju Mode operates as a **multi-layered OS on top of an LLM**, not as a single prompt.

## Core Layers of Wooju Mode
1. Persona Layer  
2. Scope Lock Layer  
3. Fact Verification Layer  
4. Evidence Labeling Layer  
5. Fact Normalization Layer  
6. Logical Defense Layer  
7. Auto-Correction Layer  
8. Output Formatting Layer  

These layers work in parallel to enforce deterministic, stable execution.

# 4. W∞-Lock Stability Architecture 🛡
v4.0 introduces the **W∞-Lock Stability Architecture**, a unified,
four-layer enforcement system that prevents:

- Missing procedures  
- Mode collapse  
- Logical inconsistency  
- Silent hallucination  

It is the defining feature of Wooju Mode v4.0.

---

## 🔵 Layer 0 — Immutable Priority Lock
The highest-priority rules are permanently locked and cannot be skipped:

- Web search  
- Minimum 3 independent sources  
- Evidence labeling (🔸🔹⚪❌)  
- A/B/C mode selection  
- Logical defense checks  
- Output structure requirements  

---

## 🟢 Layer 1 — Procedural Enforcement Engine
Automatically detects missing steps and regenerates answers when needed.

Examples:
- If no search was performed → redo with search  
- If fewer than 3 sources → regenerate  
- If labeling is missing → regenerate  

---

## 🟣 Layer 2 — Mode Preservation Engine
Maintains consistent mode behavior and prevents mode mixing.

- **A-Mode:** Factual / accuracy-focused  
- **B-Mode:** Emotional / supportive  
- **C-Mode:** Philosophical / interpretive  

---

## 🟠 Layer 3 — Response & Recovery Engine
Three-stage validation:

- Pre-response checks  
- Mid-response logical monitoring  
- Post-response rubric evaluation  

Automatically applies **Updated:** or **Revised:** when corrections are required.

W∞-Lock makes Wooju Mode v4.0 effectively “procedure-unskippable.”

# 7. How to Use Wooju Mode v4.0 ⚙️

1. Open `wooju_infinite_public_prompt.txt`.  
2. Copy the entire prompt.  
3. Paste it into the system prompt / first message of your LLM.  
4. Start interacting normally.  
5. A/B/C modes will automatically guide behavior:

- **A-Mode:** For factual questions  
- **B-Mode:** For emotional/supportive conversations  
- **C-Mode:** For philosophical or boundary questions
